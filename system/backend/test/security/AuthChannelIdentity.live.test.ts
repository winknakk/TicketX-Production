/**
 * Customer login resolved a profile's identity without naming a channel.
 *
 * All three customer-proof paths in `auth.ts` ran
 *
 *   SELECT channel_ref, org_id FROM identities WHERE profile_id::text = $1 LIMIT 1
 *
 * with no channel predicate and no ORDER BY, so the row was whatever the
 * planner returned first. A profile holding both a LINE and a WebChat identity
 * could yield the LINE `channel_ref`, which was then signed into a WebChat
 * proof as `customerId`. The handshake resolves that through
 * `findByChannelAndRef("WebChat", ref)`; the unique key is
 * `(channel, channel_ref)`, so a LINE row never satisfies it — the lookup
 * misses and the gateway creates a **new profile and identity** for someone who
 * already had both. An authentication defect could mint duplicate customers.
 *
 * These tests pin the corrected contract: resolution is scoped to the channel
 * being authenticated, deterministic, and refuses rather than inventing a
 * `channel_ref` when the profile has no identity on that channel.
 *
 * Requires PostgreSQL. Fixtures are created inside a transaction that is always
 * rolled back; the canonical rows (profile 999, identities 999/1135,
 * conversation 1210) are only ever read.
